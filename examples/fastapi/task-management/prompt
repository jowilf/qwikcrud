An application for managing tasks that enables multiple users to collaborate on a single project with multiple tasks.
The user creates a project, and each task can be assigned to multiple users, while a user can also work on multiple tasks.
Each task has a start date and a due date, with a status that can be open, in progress, or completed.
Additionally, each task can have an instruction file attached to it, which can be a PDF, a Word document, or a text file.
